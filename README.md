# aksw.org

This is the source of the aksw.org website which is served
with [OntoWiki](http://ontowiki.net) and OntoWiki's [site
extension](https://github.com/AKSW/site.ontowiki).

The repository imports site and ipc extension (in addition to Erfurt and
RDFauthor) via submodules and organizes a clean upstream branch which is
used to fetch and push OntoWiki changesets.

## Setup

To use `aksw.org` please run `make deploy` and `make custom`.
