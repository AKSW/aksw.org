    dcterms:abstract "Research in Emergent Semantics revolves around supporting semantic collaboration scenarios in an adaptive way. This work includes especially research on engineering and adoption of semantic collaboration software, semantic collaboration protocols as well as research on distributed / federated semantic social networks. To bootstrap semantic collaboration and the semantic web in general, the Emergent Semantics group also investigates basic semantic technologies and semantic web infrastructures.";

For this purpose, SIMBA develops novel and scalable approaches for RDF/OWL extraction, link discovery and graph analysis. In addition, SIMBA provides tools and frameworks that implement these approaches and allow for their swift integration into industry projects.";
