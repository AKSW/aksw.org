			The Academic Institution Internal Structure Ontology (AIISO) provides classes and properties to describe the internal organizational structure of an academic institution. AIISO is designed to work in partnership with Participation (http://purl.org/vocab/participation/schema), FOAF (http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/) and aiiso-roles (http://purl.org/vocab/aiiso-roles/schema) to describe the roles that people play within an institution.
